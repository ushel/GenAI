In early 2024, Tesla announced the launch of its long-anticipated Cybertruck, delivering the first batch to customers in the United States. The Cybertruck features a stainless steel exoskeleton and an adaptive air suspension system, targeting both commercial and recreational markets.

Later in 2024, Tesla introduced a refreshed version of the Model 3, commonly referred to as "Highland." The updated design includes a sleeker front end, improved range, and upgraded interior materials. Tesla aimed to increase Model 3 sales in both the U.S. and European markets through these enhancements.

In Q2 2024, the company opened a new Gigafactory in Mexico, expected to manufacture components for the next generation of electric vehicles. This facility is part of Tesla's ongoing global expansion.

Elon Musk also confirmed during the 2024 Investor Day event that Tesla would be advancing its work on humanoid robots, with Optimus entering limited factory trials. The robot is intended to perform repetitive or hazardous tasks within Tesla's production lines.

Finally, in mid-2024, Tesla rolled out the Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta v12.5 to over 500,000 users in North America, bringing significant improvements to lane merging, unprotected left turns, and pedestrian detection.

Overall, 2024 has been a transformative year for Tesla, marked by multiple product launches, software upgrades, and global manufacturing expansion.
