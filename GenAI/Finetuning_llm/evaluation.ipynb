First, load your pandas DataFrame into your Python environment. Next, define a Lamini type that corresponds to the columns in your DataFrame. This Lamini type will serve as a template for the data conversion. Iterate over the rows of your DataFrame, creating a Lamini object for each row. Assign the values from the DataFrame columns to the corresponding fields in the Lamini object. By performing this iterative process, you can effectively convert your data from a pandas DataFrame into the desired Lamini type.'}"
